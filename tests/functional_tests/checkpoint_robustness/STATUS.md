## Resume oracle policy

Enabled LLM, VLM, and retrieval resume coverage now compares a restored trainer
with the uninterrupted continuation of the same checkpoint-producing training
trajectory. The check requires exact optimizer/scheduler position, LR and
weight-decay state, and RNG state. Stateful-dataloader position is verified by
exact per-rank post-resume batch identity because a loader may normalize its
equivalent serialized state during restore. The first post-resume loss uses a
separate strict threshold; the existing `resume_loss_threshold` applies only to
later BF16 optimizer steps. Independently calibrated historical envelopes are
retained as the non-blocking `training_reproducibility_loss_threshold` metric
instead of weakening the shared-trajectory resume oracle.

Independent-run reproducibility is not a checkpoint-restore oracle. CI reuses
the normal finetune and checkpoint Phase 1 to report it separately and
non-blockingly, without another training run. The comparison runs only when
their model/seed, data, batch/topology, optimizer, scheduler, loss, and backend
fingerprints match; exact per-rank batch digests are then checked before loss
differences are reported. Recipe-specific resume threshold relaxations
calibrated against the former independent baseline have been removed. This
independent-run report is opportunistic rather than guaranteed coverage when
phase-specific overrides make the existing runs incomparable; the blocking
reproducibility oracle is the shared-trajectory resume comparison.

Recipes with `no_check_resume: true` remain explicitly exempt rather than being
treated as passing. Those exemptions cover model/topology-specific restore
blockers already documented in the recipe or this file (for example DeepEP/MoE
state, hybrid Mamba state, or strict optimizer-state loading for unused/frozen
parameters); they require focused fixes before resume coverage is enabled.

## Not Yet Run

(None — all models tested)

## Known Issues

- **MoE resume non-determinism**: DeepEP expert routing causes 3e-2 to 1e-1 loss diff. `--check_resume` disabled for MoE models.
- **Mamba hybrid resume non-determinism**: Nano-8B-v1 has 0.62 loss diff on resume. Mamba layers have non-deterministic state.
- **transformers 5.3 compatibility**: Flash 1B (triton_attention.py), Nano V2 (FSDP model attr), Baichuan (meta tensor).
- **TP=2 failures**: Gemma 3 (1 KV head), Baichuan (custom layers), Mistral3 (FP8 scalars). Phi-4 TP=2 fixed on main.
- **Combined QKV Phase 4 failures**: Super-49B and Super-120B PEFT produce combined projection keys (qkv_proj, gate_up_proj) in consolidated/adapter checkpoints. Vanilla HF models expect separate projections. StateDictAdapter conversion needed for Phase 4 to work.
- **Qwen3-MoE PEFT bug**: Phase 3 KL=0.84 indicates broken PEFT checkpoint save/reload. Needs investigation in Qwen3MoeStateDictAdapter.

## TODO

### Investigate failures:
1. **Super-49B Phase 4** — consolidated checkpoint has combined QKV keys. Need StateDictAdapter in Phase 4, or fix save_consolidated to split projections.
2. **Super-120B PEFT Phase 4** — same combined QKV issue for PEFT adapter weights.
3. **Qwen3-MoE PEFT bug** — investigate why Phase 3 KL=0.84 (real checkpoint bug)
### Investigate other failures (may need code fixes):
5. **Nemotron Flash 1B** — consolidated checkpoint missing triton_attention.py
6. **Nemotron Nano V2 9B** — FSDP wrapping issue
7. **Baichuan 2 7B** — meta tensor in Phase 4 HF loading
8. **Mistral3 3B** — FP8 scalar params vs FSDP2

### Infrastructure improvements:
10. **`--resume_loss_threshold`** flag — DONE (added, default 5e-3)
11. **Memory thresholds** for remaining models (Llama, GPT-OSS, Nano V3 still missing)
