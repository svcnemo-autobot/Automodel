"""OpenHands-tool-surface SWE-bench agent.

Gives the model the EXACT 3-tool surface OpenHands v0.52.1 uses — `execute_bash`,
`str_replace_editor`, `finish` (schemas + names copied verbatim from OpenHands 0.52.1) —
which is what the CoderForge SFT data was generated with. This removes the tool-surface
mismatch that crippled the SFT model under mini-swe-agent's single `bash` tool, without the
cost/risk of running the full OpenHands runtime inside each container.

Execution reuses the proven Docker-less enroot backend (`enroot_env.EnrootEnvironment`): each
instance gets its official SWE-bench image container; `execute_bash` runs bash in `/testbed`
(conda `testbed` active via BASH_ENV), and `str_replace_editor` runs a self-contained editor
(view/create/str_replace/insert/undo) in-container. Output is a `preds.json` in the standard
SWE-bench format, graded by the same local grader (`grade_enroot.py`).

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

<ROLE>
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
</ROLE>

<EFFICIENCY>
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
</EFFICIENCY>

<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>

<CODE_QUALITY>
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
</CODE_QUALITY>

<VERSION_CONTROL>
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
</VERSION_CONTROL>

<PULL_REQUESTS>
* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
</PULL_REQUESTS>

<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>

<SECURITY>
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
</SECURITY>

<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>

<TROUBLESHOOTING>
* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.

USER_TEMPLATE = """<uploaded_files>
/testbed
</uploaded_files>

I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /testbed. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
{problem}
</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.

Follow these phases to resolve the issue:

Phase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms
   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.
   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.
   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.
   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.
   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue

Phase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository
   2.1 Follow the readme
   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed
   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests

Phase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions
   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.
   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.
   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.

Phase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.
   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.
   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.
   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.
   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.

Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it
   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.
   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.
   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.
   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.
   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.

Phase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.
   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.

Phase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.
   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.
   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.
   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.


8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and verify your changes address all requirements.

   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.
   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:
     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing
     8.2.2 The files you modified
     8.2.3 The functions you changed
   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass

Be thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.
